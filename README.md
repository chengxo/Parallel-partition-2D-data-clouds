# Parallel-partition-2D-data-clounds
To compile partition.c, you should install p4est package and compile with it. See the official site of p4est package: https://p4est.github.io/
For convenience, the small executable is already included in the repo.

To run the executable, a dataset file and the total number of points needs to be provided as arguments. See sbatch files as an example.
The dataset file needs to separate each data by '\n'.
